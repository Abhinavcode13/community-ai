# ü§ñ Mifos Community AI Chatbot

Welcome to the Mifos Community AI project! This innovative tool is designed to improve support and accessibility for the global Mifos & Fineract community using the power of Generative AI.

##  Overview

As Mifos and Fineract applications grow in complexity and adoption, effective support becomes crucial. This chatbot offers a smarter way to assist implementers, developers, and new users‚Äîproviding instant, intelligent responses to questions using AI.

## Why It Matters ?

- üåêCommunity is growing rapidly ‚Üí more queries, higher support demand.
- Current help via Slack or docs is inconsistent and delayed.
- Documentation is scattered ‚Üí tough for new users to navigate.
- Response time depends on who‚Äôs available ‚Üí not reliable.
- ü§ñ This bot = 24/7 support + faster onboarding + reduced load on community mentors.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Build an intelligent chatbot to answer queries about Mifos/Fineract.
- Integrate GPT models to improve understanding and answer generation.
- Guide users to relevant documentation and code snippets.
- Pre-train using real Slack Q&A and improve iteratively.
- Make support fast, consistent, and always available.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

Here's how the repository is organized:

| Path/Folder                        | Description |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------- |
| `web-app/`                          | Contains Mifos Web App files analyzed by the chatbot. |
| `web-app_bot.ipynb`                 | Jupyter Notebook to run the chatbot locally. |
| `web_app_vector_storage_metadata/`  | Stores vector embeddings for fast information retrieval. |
| `tools/translation-helper/`         | (New!) Gemini-powered Translation Helper Tool. |
| `requirements.txt`                  | Python dependencies needed for running the chatbot and translation tool. |
| `CodeCommentingScript.py`           | Script for pre-processing the codebase and generating vector embeddings. |

---

## How It Works

- The chatbot processes and indexes the Mifos codebase, creating vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.
- When a user asks a question, the system finds the most relevant code snippets or documentation.
- The chatbot then uses GPT models to generate a human-like response based on the retrieved information.
- Responses focus on file organization, key components, and project structure.
